## Voice Training

Voice training for transfemales can provide a wide range of benefits, beyond the obvious benefit of passing. There are many resources available including guides, videos, personalized speech therapy and even [Vocal Feminization Surgery](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21779-voice-feminization-surgery) with varying results based on individual characteristics.

Some insurance or government programs may cover speech therapy and offer personalized lessons at reduced rates.

> Voice training can improve confidence and self-esteem. Many transfemales struggle with self-doubt and insecurity, and voice training can help them to develop a more confident and powerful vocal presence, gaining a greater sense of self-assurance and empowerment.

### A method from a vocal training coach to try at home

> As long as you follow these instructions, and don't try and do it all in one go, you will find your feminine voice. When a step say practice, that means until you have mastered it, NOT just do it for ten minutes and move on. Mastery of the larynx is the only way to reach the kind of vocal control you will need. If you cannot shift your larynx at will, you will not sound good. PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE!

### A step-by-step guide to vocal training

> Hey, friend. Want to change your voice? Well... you can - that's an option.

> Your voice is much more malleable than you may realize. There are at least a dozen different dimensions that you can learn to control independently to change the sound of your voice. The way you talk right now is not your one "true" voice, it is a habit. A habit that can be changed, if you so choose.

> Its possible to reduce the risk of dysphonia by teaching them techniques to use their voices in a safe and healthy way. This includes learning how to use the correct vocal techniques, such as proper breath support and pitch control, as well as how to avoid vocal strain and abuse. Voice training may also include instruction on how to speak in a lower register, which can help reduce the risk of dysphonia.

Some other methods can include a form of [Speech Shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_shadowing), more specifically *vocal shadowing*. The methods are more familiar to singers or language learners and require some understanding of the methods - and might require direct instruction.
