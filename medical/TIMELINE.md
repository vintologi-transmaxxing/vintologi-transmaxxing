## Feminizing HRT Timeline and Effects
While the degree to which an individual taking feminising hormone therapy will experience changes varies from person to person, the following table provides an indication of the HRT timeline.

 

### MTF HRT effect timeline

|Effects|Expected Onset|Expected Maximum Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Body fat redistribution|3-6 months|2-5 years|
|Decreased muscle/mass strength|3-6 months|1-2 years|
|Softening of skin/decreased oiliness|3-6 months|unknown|
|Decreased libido|1-3 months|1-2 years|
|Decreased spontaneous erections|1-3 months|3-6 months|
|Male sexual dysfunction|variable|variable|
|Breast growth|3-6 months|2-3 years|
|Decreased testicular volume|3-6 months|2-3 years|
|Decreased sperm production|variable|variable|
|Thinning and slowed growth of body and facial hair|6-12 months|>3 years|
|Male pattern baldness No regrowth, loss stops |1-3 months|1-2 years|

 

The degree and rate of physical effects depend in part on the dose, route of administration, and medications used, which are selected in accordance with a patient’s specific medical goals (e.g., changes in gender role expression, plans for sex reassignment) and medical risk profile.

There is no current evidence that response to hormone therapy – with the possible exception of voice deepening in trans masculine individuals – can be reliably predicted based on age, body habitus, ethnicity, or family appearance. All other factors being equal, there is no evidence to suggest that any medically approved type or method of administering hormones is more effective than any other in producing the desired physical changes.
